## üîç What It Does

- Detects new rounds automatically
- Tracks player count and total bets during growth
- Waits until player count freezes (no growth for 2 seconds)
- Applies a **60% rule** to calculate a predicted crash cap
- Compares it against the **total winnings**
- Logs `‚úÖ SUCCESS` if actual winnings are below the predicted cap, or `‚ùå FAILURE` if they exceed
- Runs infinitely and automatically across game sessions

## üí° Why the 60% Rule?

Based on observed patterns and common game design in crash-style betting games, platforms like 1xBet often seem to **limit payout liquidity** to ensure profit margins.  
This script assumes that total winnings in a round **typically won‚Äôt exceed 60% of total bets**, based on this kind of internal control logic.

You can adjust this threshold in the code to suit your own experiments.

```js
const predictedCrash = Math.floor(totalBets * 0.6); // Change 0.6 to your own ratio
```
